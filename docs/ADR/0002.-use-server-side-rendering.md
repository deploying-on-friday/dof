# ADR 0002: Use Server-Side Rendering for the Web Interface

**Date:** 2026-02-09  
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

There are two main approaches for rendering the frontend:

- Client-side rendering (CSR), where JavaScript in the browser builds the user interface.
- Server-side rendering (SSR), where the server generates complete HTML pages and sends them to the browser.

Given the small size of the project and the goal of keeping the architecture simple, a decision was needed on which rendering approach to use.

## Decision

We decided to use server-side rendering (SSR).  
The Go application will generate HTML using templates on the server and send fully rendered pages to the client.

## Reasoning

- Server-side rendering reduces architectural complexity by avoiding a separate frontend application.
- It simplifies deployment and DevOps processes by keeping the system as a single service.
- The project does not require highly dynamic or interactive frontend behavior.

## Consequences

- The frontend will be simpler and may require full page reloads for some interactions.
- No separate frontend build tools or JavaScript frameworks are required.
- The system will be easier to debug and operate due to fewer moving parts.
- This decision can be revisited if future requirements demand richer client-side functionality.
